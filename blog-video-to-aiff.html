                                Yes, AIFF files are the standard format for professional audio editing software including Logic Pro, Pro Tools, Adobe Audition, and others. AIFF format is preferred for audio editing because it's uncompressed and preserves maximum quality.

                                While there's no strict video length limit, we recommend videos under 10 minutes for optimal performance. Longer videos may take significantly more time to process. The extracted AIFF will maintain the full audio quality from your original video.
