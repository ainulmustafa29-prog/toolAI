                    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>AIVOROPRO (“AIVOROPRO”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) develops browser-based AI utilities that transform, enhance, and convert media content without requiring downloads or installations. This Privacy Policy describes the categories of information we collect, the purposes for which we process that information, the lawful bases relied upon, and the choices available to visitors, registered users, and enterprise customers (“you”). We drafted this policy to be comprehensive and respectful, and the sections below expand on every facet of our data practices so that you can make well-informed decisions about using our services.</p>

                    <h2>2. Scope of This Policy</h2>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the AIVOROPRO website, mobile-friendly experience, APIs, customer support interactions, beta programs, newsletters, and any branded microsite or campaign that links to this document. Separate contractual terms may govern enterprise integrations or reseller arrangements; however, those contracts will either incorporate this policy or outline privacy terms that provide equal or greater protections.</p>

                    <h2>3. Definitions</h2>
                    <p>For clarity, “personal data” means any information that identifies or relates to an identifiable individual. “Processing” covers any operation performed on personal data, including collection, storage, alteration, and deletion. “User content” refers to files, prompts, or metadata that you upload into our tools for transformation. “Automated decision making” refers to algorithmic recommendations or moderation actions with legal or similarly significant effects on you.</p>

                    <h2>4. Information We Collect</h2>
                    <p>We limit collection to the minimum required to operate, secure, and improve our platform. Depending on the feature, we may collect:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Account identifiers:</strong> name, email address, password hash, authentication tokens, and support ticket history.</li>
                        <li><strong>Transactional records:</strong> subscription tier, payment confirmations processed through PCI-compliant partners, invoice history, and applied discounts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Usage telemetry:</strong> tool selections, dates and times of sessions, approximate geographic region inferred from IP (city-level granularity), operating system and browser type, progress indicators, and error logs that help us debug performance.</li>
                        <li><strong>User content:</strong> media files, prompts, or project names you actively upload for processing, plus derived metadata (resolution, duration, codec, color profile) essential to deliver accurate outputs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Communications:</strong> emails, chat transcripts, social media direct messages, surveys, community forum posts, testimonials, and satisfaction scores.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cookie and similar technologies:</strong> preference cookies (theme mode, language, last-used tool), authentication cookies, analytics tags, and optional marketing cookies if you consent.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>5. How We Collect Information</h2>
                    <p>We collect data directly from you when you complete forms, sign into your account, upload files, submit support tickets, or participate in research calls. We also collect data automatically via cookies, local storage, service logs, and device sensors that indicate browser performance traits. Finally, we may obtain information from third parties such as identity providers (for single sign-on), payment processors, anti-fraud databases, or public sources when verifying the legitimacy of a business account.</p>

                    <h2>6. Legal Bases for Processing</h2>
                    <p>If you reside in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Brazil, or other jurisdiction requiring a lawful basis, our processing relies on one or more of the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Contractual necessity:</strong> to deliver the services you request, troubleshoot issues, and fulfill billing obligations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> to secure our platform, prevent abuse, understand how features perform, and market similar services to existing customers without overriding your rights.</li>
                        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> for optional cookies, newsletters, testimonials, or beta programs. You may withdraw consent at any time without affecting prior lawful processing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legal compliance:</strong> to meet tax, accounting, law enforcement, and regulatory requirements.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>7. Purposes of Processing</h2>
                    <p>We process information for multiple legitimate reasons, including: enabling real-time media conversion; personalizing interface defaults; monitoring uptime and reliability; enforcing our Terms &amp; Conditions; communicating product updates; detecting malicious automation; conducting user research to prioritize roadmap decisions; and generating aggregated, anonymized analytics that help us understand adoption trends without revealing individual identities.</p>

                    <h2>8. File Processing and Retention</h2>
                    <p>Files uploaded to AIVOROPRO are processed in volatile memory whenever technically possible. For tools that require chunked uploads, intermediary shards may be encrypted at rest for the duration of the session and purged automatically after completion, timeout, or user cancellation. We never examine the contents of user files for purposes unrelated to providing the requested service, and we do not use your files to train proprietary AI models unless you explicitly opt in through advanced labs programs. Diagnostic copies are generated only if you grant explicit permission while reporting a bug, and those copies are deleted within 72 hours unless legal obligations require longer retention.</p>

                    <h2>9. Cookies, Local Storage, and Tracking Technologies</h2>
                    <p>We rely on a mix of strictly necessary cookies (session management, fraud prevention), functional cookies (remembering selected tools, dark mode, audio preferences), and analytics cookies (measuring conversion funnels, campaign attribution). We provide a cookie banner that lets you opt down to essential cookies. Local storage entries are used for caching frequently accessed assets so the site loads faster and for storing non-sensitive preferences. We do not use fingerprinting or cross-site tracking beacons.</p>

                    <h2>10. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
                    <p>We use privacy-focused analytics providers that aggregate usage metrics and truncate IP addresses. Some marketing campaigns rely on consented tracking pixels to understand which outreach efforts succeed. We do not sell personal data or share identifiable behavioral profiles with advertisers. When we sponsor content or collaborate with partners, aggregated metrics may be shared to demonstrate campaign performance without exposing individual user journeys.</p>

                    <h2>11. Communications Preferences</h2>
                    <p>When you sign up, you may opt into product announcements, educational sequences, and promotional offers. Each email includes a one-click unsubscribe link and instructions for updating your preferences inside your dashboard. Transactional communications—password resets, critical incident notifications, or changes to legal documents—are mandatory to ensure you remain informed about your account.</p>

                    <h2>12. Data Retention</h2>
                    <p>We retain account records for as long as you maintain an active relationship with us, plus any additional period required for audits, dispute resolution, and regulatory compliance. Inactive accounts that show no sign-in activity for twenty-four consecutive months may be anonymized or deleted after advance notice. Support tickets, survey results, and product feedback are anonymized once operational needs conclude.</p>

                    <h2>13. Security Measures</h2>
                    <p>AIVOROPRO implements layered safeguards such as TLS 1.3 encryption, strict content security policies, firewalls, DDoS protection, static analysis, role-based access controls, and minimum-privilege staff access. We conduct periodic penetration tests and maintain an internal security committee that reviews incident reports, vendor access, and vulnerability disclosures. No platform can guarantee absolute security, but we commit to timely notification if a breach meeting legal thresholds occurs.</p>

                    <h2>14. Children’s Privacy</h2>
                    <p>Our services are designed for users aged sixteen and older. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children below the applicable age of digital consent. If we learn that a child has submitted personal data without verifiable parental consent, we will delete the data and work with the guardian to resolve any concerns.</p>

                    <h2>15. International Data Transfers</h2>
                    <p>We operate infrastructure in multiple regions to optimize speed and redundancy. Whenever personal data moves across borders, we rely on approved mechanisms including Standard Contractual Clauses, adequacy decisions, and vendor privacy addenda that require equivalent security commitments. Our privacy team regularly reviews vendor compliance documentation and may suspend or terminate partnerships that fail to meet contractual safeguards.</p>

                    <h2>16. Third-Party Processors</h2>
                    <p>Trusted service providers assist with hosting, content delivery networks, analytics, customer support, payment processing, and email distribution. Each processor is contractually bound to handle personal data only on our instructions, implement industry-standard controls, and notify us promptly about incidents. A current list of subprocessors is available upon request, and we will provide at least thirty days’ notice before materially changing that list.</p>

                    <h2>17. Automated Decision-Making and Profiling</h2>
                    <p>We rely on automation to grade system health, detect obvious fraud, and tailor onboarding flows. These decisions do not have legal or similarly significant effects on you. If a processing outcome denies you access or flags your account for review, you can request human intervention by contacting privacy@aivoropro.com, and a qualified specialist will reassess the decision.</p>

                    <h2>18. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
                    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to access, rectify, erase, port, or restrict processing of your personal data; object to certain processing; withdraw consent; or lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. We verify identity before honoring requests to protect your data from unauthorized changes. Requests are typically fulfilled within thirty days unless complexity warrants a reasonable extension, in which case we will keep you informed.</p>

                    <h2>19. Exercising Data Subject Requests</h2>
                    <p>To submit a privacy request, email <a href="mailto:privacy@aivoropro.com">privacy@aivoropro.com</a> or use the in-dashboard privacy center. Include the email associated with your account, the request type, and any supporting context. We may ask you to confirm ownership via a verification link or secure portal. Once verified, we will explain the steps taken, cite any legal exemptions, and log the outcome for accountability.</p>

                    <h2>20. California, Virginia, and Similar Disclosures</h2>
                    <p>Residents of California, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and other U.S. states with comprehensive privacy statutes receive additional disclosures: we do not sell or share personal information as defined by those laws; we honor “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” signals; we recognize opt-out preference signals supported by major browsers; and you may designate an authorized agent to act on your behalf by providing written permission and verifying your identity directly.</p>

                    <h2>21. Data Breach Response</h2>
                    <p>We maintain an incident response playbook that defines escalation paths, roles, evidence preservation procedures, and communication timelines. If a breach is likely to result in harm, we will notify affected users and relevant regulators without undue delay, summarize the categories of data involved, outline mitigation measures, and provide contact details for follow-up questions.</p>

                    <h2>22. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p>We periodically update this policy to reflect new features, regulatory guidance, or feedback from our community. Material updates will be announced through banners, email notifications, or dashboard alerts at least seven days before taking effect unless immediate changes are required for security or legal reasons. Continued use of the services after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

                    <h2>23. Contact Information</h2>
