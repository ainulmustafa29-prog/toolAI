                    <h2>1. Purpose of This Disclaimer</h2>
                    <p>This Disclaimer clarifies the limits of responsibility, warranty, and liability associated with your use of AIVOROPRO’s website, APIs, desktop integrations, plug-ins, marketing collateral, and all related communications. Because our AI-assisted utilities process highly diverse media, your careful review of these statements ensures you understand the extent to which you must evaluate, verify, and lawfully deploy every output generated through our tools.</p>

                    <h2>2. Informational Nature of Content</h2>
                    <p>All tutorials, blog articles, webinars, marketing descriptions, and support responses are provided for informational purposes only. They do not constitute legal, financial, design, engineering, or cybersecurity advice. Any reliance on narratives, screenshots, metrics, or testimonials published by AIVOROPRO or its community members is undertaken at your own risk, and you should consult qualified professionals before making decisions that could affect compliance obligations, revenue, or brand reputation.</p>

                    <h2>3. Service Availability and Continuity</h2>
                    <p>We strive to maintain a reliable platform but cannot guarantee uninterrupted service. Scheduled maintenance, emergency fixes, third-party outages, force majeure events, or regulatory directives may temporarily limit or suspend access. You acknowledge that such interruptions can occur without notice and agree that AIVOROPRO is not responsible for resulting losses, including missed deadlines, contract penalties, or opportunity costs.</p>

                    <h2>4. “As-Is” and “As-Available” Basis</h2>
                    <p>AIVOROPRO delivers all Services “as is” and “as available”. We expressly disclaim warranties of accuracy, completeness, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment, title, and non-infringement. No information, whether oral, visual, or written, shall create a warranty unless specifically confirmed in a signed agreement. You are solely responsible for determining whether our outputs meet your technical, aesthetic, and regulatory standards.</p>

                    <h2>5. Limitations on AI Accuracy</h2>
                    <p>Artificial intelligence models can misclassify content, fail to recognize subtle defects, or produce artifacts. Output quality depends on the resolution, bitrate, color space, compression method, presence of noise, and other characteristics of the source material. You acknowledge that AI-ready results cannot be guaranteed and that you must manually review and test outputs before commercial deployment, public distribution, or archival storage.</p>

                    <h2>6. No Guarantee of Compliance</h2>
                    <p>Because laws governing biometric data, likeness rights, copyright, accessibility, advertising disclosures, and export controls vary by jurisdiction and evolve frequently, we cannot guarantee that use of our Services complies with every regulation. You are responsible for securing necessary consents, licensing rights, export permits, and accessibility reviews, and for ensuring that your use of AIVOROPRO aligns with local statutes, industry codes of conduct, and contractual duties.</p>

                    <h2>7. User Responsibility and Due Diligence</h2>
                    <p>You are solely responsible for understanding what you upload, how you transform it, where you distribute results, and how you store derived assets. This includes verifying that you hold the necessary rights, maintaining backups of original files, scanning outputs for malware before sharing, and testing files on target devices. You must not rely on AIVOROPRO as your exclusive archive or compliance system.</p>

                    <h2>8. File Storage and Transmission Risks</h2>
                    <p>Although we endeavor to process files in volatile memory, transient copies may exist in caches, queues, or encrypted storage while tasks complete. Transmission across public networks carries inherent risks outside our control. By using the Services, you accept that absolute security is unattainable and agree not to upload materials that would create disproportionate harm if intercepted, corrupted, or lost.</p>

                    <h2>9. Output Ownership and Verification</h2>
                    <p>Unless a specific tool indicates otherwise, you own the outputs generated from your inputs. However, ownership does not imply that outputs are free from third-party rights. Before monetizing or publishing results, you must confirm that all elements, including embedded fonts, stock content, or recognizable individuals, are appropriately licensed or released.</p>

                    <h2>10. Links and Third-Party References</h2>
                    <p>Our website may contain links to third-party resources or mention brands for comparative purposes. Such references do not imply endorsement. We do not control and are not responsible for third-party websites, privacy practices, terms, or services. You assume all risk when visiting external sites or integrating third-party APIs.</p>

                    <h2>11. No Professional Advice</h2>
                    <p>AIVOROPRO’s staff, ambassadors, or community moderators may share personal workflows or opinions. These statements should not be interpreted as professional advice tailored to your circumstances. Always seek independent counsel before implementing critical workflows, regulatory strategies, cybersecurity defenses, or medical/educational accommodations.</p>

                    <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, AIVOROPRO, its affiliates, officers, employees, contractors, suppliers, and licensors are not liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or special damages arising from or related to the Services. This includes lost profits, lost goodwill, lost or corrupted data, service interruption, or procurement of substitute services. Our total liability for any claim shall not exceed the greater of one hundred (100) U.S. dollars or the fees paid by you to AIVOROPRO during the three (3) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.</p>

                    <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
                    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless AIVOROPRO from claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the Services, your violation of this Disclaimer or the Terms &amp; Conditions, your infringement of intellectual property rights, or any content that you process, publish, or share via our platform.</p>

                    <h2>14. Future Modifications</h2>
                    <p>We may update this Disclaimer to reflect legal developments, product changes, or operational insights. The “Last updated” date indicates the most recent revision. Material updates will be communicated through the website or by email. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

                    <h2>15. Contact Information</h2>
                    <p>If you have questions about this Disclaimer, please reach us at <a href="mailto:contact@aivoropro.com">contact@aivoropro.com</a> or via the support portal in your dashboard. We recommend consulting legal counsel for customized advice about your obligations.</p>
