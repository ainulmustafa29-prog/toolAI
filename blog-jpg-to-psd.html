                                Conversion is very fast, typically taking just a few seconds. The time depends on image size, with smaller images converting almost instantly and larger images taking a few seconds. The process is optimized for speed while maintaining quality.

                                Will the file size increase?
                            </button>
                        </h3>

                            <div class="accordion-body">
                                PSD files are typically larger than JPG files because PSD format uses uncompressed or less compressed storage to preserve editing capabilities. The file size increase depends on the image, but PSD files are generally larger to support layers and advanced features. This is the trade-off for professional editing capabilities.

                                Is there a file size limit?

                                While there's no strict file size limit, we recommend images under 10MB for optimal performance. Larger files may take longer to process. The converted PSD will maintain the original image's resolution and quality.
