                                EPS 8, 9, and 10 refer to different versions of the EPS format specification. EPS 10 is the most modern and widely supported version, while EPS 8 and 9 are older versions that may be required for compatibility with older software or printing systems. Choose the version based on your specific requirements or software compatibility needs.

                                Will converting JPG to EPS improve image quality?

                                Converting JPG to EPS won't restore quality that was lost during JPG compression, but EPS format uses PostScript encoding which can preserve quality better for printing applications. EPS is better for images that will be used in professional printing or design software, as it's optimized for those applications.
