                                Converting JPG to PNG won't restore quality that was lost during JPG compression, but PNG format uses lossless compression, so no additional quality is lost. PNG is better for images that will be edited multiple times, as it preserves quality through edits. For images with transparency needs or requiring lossless compression, PNG is the better choice.

                                Does PNG support transparency?

                                Yes, PNG format supports transparency, which is one of its key advantages over JPG. This makes PNG ideal for logos, graphics, and images that need transparent backgrounds. However, converting a JPG (which doesn't have transparency) to PNG won't add transparency - it will maintain the JPG's background.

                                Conversion is very fast, typically taking just a few seconds. The time depends on image size, with smaller images converting almost instantly and larger images taking a few seconds. The process is optimized for speed while maintaining quality.

                                Will the file size increase?
                            </button>
                        </h3>

                            <div class="accordion-body">
                                PNG files are typically larger than JPG files because PNG uses lossless compression while JPG uses lossy compression. The file size increase depends on the image content, but PNG files are generally 2-5 times larger than equivalent JPG files. This is the trade-off for lossless quality and transparency support.

                                Is there a file size limit?

                                While there's no strict file size limit, we recommend images under 10MB for optimal performance. Larger files may take longer to process. The converted PNG will maintain the original image's resolution and quality.
