                                Yes, WEBP files are typically 25-35% smaller than equivalent JPG files while maintaining similar or better quality. This is due to WEBP's advanced compression algorithms that are more efficient than JPG's compression. The file size reduction helps improve website performance and reduces bandwidth usage.

                                WEBP format is supported by all major modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Opera. Support for older browsers may be limited, so it's recommended to provide JPG fallbacks for maximum compatibility. For modern websites, WEBP is an excellent choice for better performance.

                                Conversion is very fast, typically taking just a few seconds. The time depends on image size, with smaller images converting almost instantly and larger images taking a few seconds. The process is optimized for speed while maintaining quality.

                                Yes, WEBP format supports transparency, similar to PNG format. However, converting a JPG (which doesn't have transparency) to WEBP won't add transparency - it will maintain the JPG's background. For transparency, you would need to use a tool like our AI Image Background Remover first.

                                While there's no strict file size limit, we recommend images under 10MB for optimal performance. Larger files may take longer to process. The converted WEBP will maintain the original image's resolution and quality but will be significantly smaller in file size.
