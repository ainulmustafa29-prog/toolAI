                                Will converting JPG to BMP improve image quality?

                                Converting JPG to BMP won't restore quality that was lost during JPG compression, but BMP format uses uncompressed storage, so no additional quality is lost. BMP is better for images that need exact pixel representation or will be edited multiple times, as it preserves quality through edits without compression artifacts.

                                Will the file size increase?

                                Yes, BMP files are significantly larger than JPG files because BMP format uses uncompressed storage. The file size increase depends on the image, but BMP files are generally 5-20 times larger than equivalent JPG files. This is the trade-off for uncompressed, lossless quality.

                                Yes, BMP format is widely supported by most image viewers, editors, and operating systems. It's one of the oldest and most compatible image formats, making it ideal for applications requiring broad compatibility. However, due to large file sizes, it's less commonly used for web or storage purposes.

                                While there's no strict file size limit, we recommend images under 10MB for optimal performance. Larger files may take longer to process. The converted BMP will maintain the original image's resolution and quality, but will be significantly larger in file size.
