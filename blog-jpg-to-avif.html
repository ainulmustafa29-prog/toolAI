                                Yes, AVIF files are typically 50% smaller than equivalent JPG files while maintaining similar or better quality. This is due to AVIF's cutting-edge compression algorithms that are significantly more efficient than JPG's compression. The dramatic file size reduction helps improve website performance and reduces bandwidth usage substantially.

                                AVIF format is supported by modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera. Safari support is available in newer versions. Support for older browsers may be limited, so it's recommended to provide JPG or WEBP fallbacks for maximum compatibility. For modern websites, AVIF is an excellent choice for superior performance.

                                Conversion is very fast, typically taking just a few seconds. The time depends on image size, with smaller images converting almost instantly and larger images taking a few seconds. The process is optimized for speed while maintaining quality.

                                Yes, AVIF format supports transparency, similar to PNG format. However, converting a JPG (which doesn't have transparency) to AVIF won't add transparency - it will maintain the JPG's background. For transparency, you would need to use a tool like our AI Image Background Remover first.

                                While there's no strict file size limit, we recommend images under 10MB for optimal performance. Larger files may take longer to process. The converted AVIF will maintain the original image's resolution and quality but will be significantly smaller in file size.
