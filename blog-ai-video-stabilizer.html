                                Our AI is highly effective at stabilizing shaky videos. The algorithm analyzes motion patterns and applies intelligent corrections to eliminate camera shake while maintaining natural movement. The effectiveness depends on the severity of shake, but typically achieves significant improvement, making shaky footage much more watchable and professional.

                                Will stabilization crop the video?

                                Stabilization may result in slight cropping as the algorithm corrects for movement. The amount of cropping depends on the severity of shake - more shake requires more correction and may result in more cropping. The AI minimizes cropping while maximizing stabilization effectiveness.

                                The tool is most effective on videos with mild to moderate shake. Severely shaky videos where movement is extreme may have limitations, as excessive correction can result in significant cropping or artifacts. However, the tool can significantly improve most shaky videos, making them much more usable.

                                While there's no strict video length limit, we recommend videos under 10 minutes for optimal performance. Longer videos may take significantly more time to process. The stabilized output maintains the original video resolution and quality.
