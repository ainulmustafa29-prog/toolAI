                                What is lossless audio quality?

                                Lossless audio quality means the audio is preserved exactly as it was in the original source without any quality loss. FLAC format uses lossless compression, which means it preserves perfect audio quality while reducing file size through compression algorithms. This is different from lossy formats like MP3 that discard some audio data.

                                Will FLAC files be larger than MP3?
                            </button>

                                Yes, FLAC files are larger than MP3 files because FLAC is lossless while MP3 is lossy. FLAC files are typically 3-5 times larger than equivalent MP3 files, but they preserve perfect audio quality. This is the trade-off for lossless, uncompressed quality.

                                Processing time varies based on video length. Short videos (under 1 minute) typically process in 1-2 minutes, while longer videos may take 5-10 minutes. The process extracts audio and converts to FLAC efficiently.

                                While there's no strict video length limit, we recommend videos under 10 minutes for optimal performance. Longer videos may take significantly more time to process. The extracted FLAC will maintain the full lossless audio quality from your original video.
