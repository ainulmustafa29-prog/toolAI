                <!-- Why Use This Tool? -->
                <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Why Use This Tool?</h2>
                <p>The AI Video Upscaler solves the common problem of low-resolution videos that can't be used for modern displays or professional purposes. Traditional upscaling methods simply stretch pixels, resulting in blurry, pixelated videos. Our AI-powered tool understands video content and intelligently fills in missing pixels, creating sharp, clear videos that look natural and professional. Whether you need to enhance videos for 4K displays, improve footage for streaming platforms, or upscale old videos for modern use, this tool delivers exceptional results. The AI analyzes motion, textures, and details to maintain quality while increasing resolution, making it perfect for videographers, content creators, filmmakers, and anyone who works with video content.</p>

                <!-- Popular Use Cases -->
                <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Popular Use Cases</h2>
                <p>The AI Video Upscaler is invaluable in numerous scenarios. Videographers upscale footage for 4K displays and modern streaming platforms. Content creators enhance videos for YouTube, social media, and online distribution. Filmmakers improve archival footage for restoration projects. Businesses upscale promotional videos for high-resolution displays. The tool is also perfect for restoring old, low-resolution videos and making them suitable for modern use. Whether you're working with home videos, professional footage, or archival content, this tool can significantly improve resolution and quality.</p>

                                2x upscaling doubles both width and height (4x total pixels), 4x quadruples dimensions (16x total pixels), HD upscales to 1280x720 or 1920x1080 resolution, and 4K upscales to 3840x2160 resolution. Choose based on your original video resolution and target display needs. Higher upscaling factors provide more detail but require more processing time.

                                Processing time varies based on video length, resolution, and upscaling factor. Short videos (under 1 minute) typically process in 5-15 minutes, while longer videos may take 30-60 minutes. Higher upscaling factors (4K) require more processing time than lower factors (2x).

                                While there's no strict video length limit, we recommend videos under 10 minutes for optimal performance. Longer videos may take significantly more time to process. The upscaled output will be significantly larger than the original, so ensure you have sufficient storage space.
