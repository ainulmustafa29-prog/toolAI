                    <h2>1. Overview and Acceptance</h2>
                    <p>These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) constitute a binding agreement between AIVOROPRO (“AIVOROPRO”, “we”, “our”, “us”) and each person or organization (“you”, “user”, “customer”) that accesses, purchases, or interacts with our websites, applications, APIs, media processing services, or any other property under the AIVOROPRO brand (collectively, the “Services”). By accessing the Services, clicking “I Agree”, creating an account, or uploading files, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Services immediately.</p>

                    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
                    <p>You must be at least sixteen (16) years old or the age of majority in your jurisdiction to use the Services. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms, that any organization you represent has authorized you to bind it to these Terms, and that you will comply with all applicable laws.</p>

                    <h2>3. Account Creation and Security</h2>
                    <p>Some features require registration. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information and to update it as needed. You are responsible for safeguarding your password and any access tokens. Notify us immediately at security@aivoropro.com if you suspect unauthorized use of your account. We may suspend or terminate accounts that are inactive for extended periods, fail to pass verification, or breach these Terms.</p>

                    <h2>4. Service Description</h2>
                    <p>AIVOROPRO offers AI-assisted tools for image, audio, and video processing, including format conversion, quality enhancement, background removal, and batch automation. Features evolve regularly, and we may add, modify, or discontinue tools. Certain tools may remain in beta; their reliability may differ from generally available features.</p>

                    <h2>5. Subscription Plans and Payments</h2>
                    <p>We provide free and paid tiers. Paid plans are billed in advance according to the schedule displayed during checkout. Prices exclude taxes unless stated otherwise. By submitting payment details, you authorize AIVOROPRO or its payment processors to charge the applicable fees. Subscriptions renew automatically until canceled. You can cancel any time from your dashboard; cancellations take effect at the end of the current billing cycle. We may change pricing with at least thirty (30) days’ notice to the email on file.</p>

                    <h2>6. Refund Policy</h2>
                    <p>Because our Services deliver immediate, non-returnable value, fees are generally non-refundable. However, we may, at our sole discretion, issue pro-rated refunds for documented outages that materially prevent you from using a paid plan for more than forty-eight (48) consecutive hours, provided you notify us within seven (7) days of the incident.</p>

                    <h2>7. Acceptable Use</h2>
                    <p>You agree not to misuse the Services. Prohibited activities include, but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Uploading content that is illegal, defamatory, infringing, obscene, hateful, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
                        <li>Violating intellectual property, privacy, or publicity rights of others.</li>
                        <li>Reverse engineering, scraping, or attempting to access non-public APIs without permission.</li>
                        <li>Deploying malware, using the Services for denial-of-service attacks, or interfering with the integrity or availability of the Services.</li>
                        <li>Sharing login credentials, reselling outputs without proper licensing, or misrepresenting affiliation with AIVOROPRO.</li>
                        <li>Bypassing file-size limits, rate limits, or security features.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We may suspend or terminate accounts that breach this section and report illegal conduct to authorities.</p>

                    <h2>8. User Content</h2>
                    <p>You retain ownership of the files, prompts, and media you upload (“User Content”). By uploading User Content, you grant AIVOROPRO a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, and sublicensable license to host, process, reproduce, and display that content solely for delivering and improving the Services. You represent that you have all necessary rights to grant this license, and you remain responsible for backups of your User Content.</p>

                    <h2>9. Output Ownership and Licensing</h2>
                    <p>Unless specific tools indicate otherwise, you own the outputs generated from your User Content. AIVOROPRO does not claim rights over results created through standard tool workflows. However, if you share outputs publicly and tag AIVOROPRO, you grant us permission to showcase those outputs for marketing, testimonial, or case-study purposes, subject to honoring any written opt-out.</p>

                    <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
                    <p>The Services, including software, interfaces, algorithms, content, trademarks, and documentation, are owned by AIVOROPRO or its licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws. Except for rights expressly granted in these Terms, no licenses are given. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the Services without prior written consent.</p>

                    <h2>11. Feedback</h2>
                    <p>If you provide feedback or suggestions, you grant AIVOROPRO a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use that feedback for any purpose without obligation to you. Providing feedback does not create confidentiality obligations unless both parties sign a separate agreement.</p>

                    <h2>12. Beta Features and Experimental Tools</h2>
                    <p>Beta features may contain bugs, operate more slowly, or change without notice. By enabling a beta or experimental tool, you acknowledge that it is provided “as is”, that performance metrics or outputs may differ from production standards, and that we may collect diagnostic data to improve accuracy. You may opt out of beta participation at any time, though previously generated outputs may remain subject to beta conditions.</p>

                    <h2>13. Third-Party Services</h2>
                    <p>The Services may integrate third-party APIs, plugins, or storage. We are not responsible for third-party content, terms, or privacy practices. If you enable a third-party integration, you authorize us to exchange information necessary to facilitate that integration. Disputes arising from third-party services must be resolved directly with the provider.</p>

                    <h2>14. Service Availability and Maintenance</h2>
                    <p>We strive for high availability but do not guarantee uninterrupted uptime. Scheduled maintenance windows will be announced on our status page whenever practicable. Emergency maintenance may occur without notice. We are not liable for downtime caused by factors outside our reasonable control, such as internet backbone failures, natural disasters, or vendor outages.</p>

                    <h2>15. Support Commitments</h2>
                    <p>Free-tier users receive community-level support and knowledge base access. Paid plans include priority email support with response targets defined on the pricing page. Enterprise plans may include dedicated success managers, custom SLAs, and escalation paths defined in a separate agreement.</p>

                    <h2>16. Data Protection and Privacy</h2>
                    <p>Our Privacy Policy, incorporated by reference, explains how we collect, use, and safeguard personal data. By using the Services, you consent to AIVOROPRO’s data practices described therein. In case of conflict between these Terms and the Privacy Policy, these Terms govern contractual obligations while the Privacy Policy governs privacy-specific commitments.</p>

                    <h2>17. Warranties and Disclaimers</h2>
                    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Services are provided “as is” and “as available”. AIVOROPRO disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the Services will meet your requirements, produce error-free outputs, or operate uninterrupted. You are solely responsible for verifying that outputs meet quality, compliance, and accuracy needs before deploying them.</p>

                    <h2>18. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, AIVOROPRO and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, suppliers, and licensors are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages, including lost profits, lost data, business interruption, or goodwill. Our aggregate liability for all claims arising from or relating to the Services is limited to the amount paid for the Services during the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to liability or one hundred (100) U.S. dollars, whichever is greater. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so portions of this clause may not apply to you.</p>

                    <h2>19. Indemnification</h2>
                    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless AIVOROPRO, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the Services, your User Content, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any law or third-party rights.</p>

                    <h2>20. Confidentiality</h2>
                    <p>Each party agrees to protect confidential information disclosed by the other party. Confidential information includes non-public business plans, technical data, security reports, roadmap materials, and other information marked or reasonably understood as confidential. Confidentiality obligations do not apply to information that becomes public through no fault of the receiving party, was already known, is independently developed, or is disclosed with permission. We may disclose confidential information if required by law, provided we give reasonable notice and cooperate with efforts to seek protective orders.</p>

                    <h2>21. Export Compliance</h2>
                    <p>You may not use the Services in violation of export control or sanctions laws administered by the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, or other relevant authorities. By using the Services, you affirm that you are not located in a restricted country and are not a denied party.</p>

                    <h2>22. Government Use</h2>
                    <p>If you are a U.S. government entity, the Services are provided as “Commercial Computer Software” and “Commercial Computer Software Documentation” under FAR 12.212 and DFARS 227.7202, and the government’s rights are limited to those stated in these Terms.</p>

                    <h2>23. Suspension and Termination</h2>
                    <p>We may suspend or terminate access immediately if you breach these Terms, if your use poses a security risk, or if required by law. Upon termination, your right to use the Services ceases, and sections intended to survive (including payment obligations, intellectual property, disclaimers, limitations of liability, and indemnities) remain in effect. You may terminate at any time by closing your account; however, fees already paid are non-refundable unless stated otherwise.</p>

                    <h2>24. Force Majeure</h2>
                    <p>Neither party is liable for failures caused by events beyond reasonable control, including acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots, epidemic, labor disputes, utility failures, or governmental actions, provided that the affected party uses reasonable efforts to mitigate impact.</p>

                    <h2>25. Dispute Resolution</h2>
                    <p>We encourage informal resolution. Please contact support@aivoropro.com with the subject line “Dispute Notice” and provide details; we will attempt to resolve disputes within thirty (30) days. If unresolved, disputes will be governed by the arbitration clause below unless local law prohibits arbitration for your claim type.</p>

                    <h2>26. Arbitration Agreement</h2>
                    <p>Except where prohibited, any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. Arbitration will take place in Seattle, Washington, USA, before a single arbitrator. Each party pays its own costs; arbitration fees are split equally. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief or damages consistent with these Terms. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. This clause does not prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief in court to protect intellectual property or confidential information.</p>

                    <h2>27. Class Action Waiver</h2>
                    <p>You agree that disputes will be resolved only on an individual basis, and neither party may bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not permitted.</p>

                    <h2>28. Governing Law and Venue</h2>
                    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Washington, United States, without regard to conflict of laws principles. Subject to the arbitration agreement, courts located in King County, Washington, have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from or relating to these Terms.</p>

                    <h2>29. Changes to These Terms</h2>
                    <p>We may update these Terms to reflect new features, legal requirements, or business practices. We will notify you of material changes via email or dashboard alerts at least seven (7) days before they take effect, unless immediate changes are required for legal or security reasons. Your continued use of the Services after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

                    <h2>30. Assignment</h2>
                    <p>You may not assign or transfer your rights under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, provided the assignee agrees to honor these Terms.</p>

                    <h2>31. Notices</h2>
                    <p>Official notices must be delivered via email to legal@aivoropro.com with a subject line indicating “Legal Notice”. We will send notices to the email associated with your account. Notices are deemed received when sent, provided no delivery failure notice is returned.</p>

                    <h2>32. Entire Agreement</h2>
                    <p>These Terms, together with any applicable order forms, enterprise agreements, and policies referenced herein (including the Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and Acceptable Use Policy), constitute the entire agreement between you and AIVOROPRO and supersede prior or contemporaneous agreements, proposals, or representations relating to the Services.</p>

                    <h2>33. Severability</h2>
                    <p>If any clause is found unenforceable, the remaining clauses remain in effect. The invalid clause shall be replaced by a valid clause that best reflects the parties’ intent.</p>

                    <h2>34. Waiver</h2>
                    <p>Failure to enforce any provision shall not constitute a waiver of that provision or any other provision. A waiver is effective only if in writing and signed by an authorized representative.</p>

                    <h2>35. Interpretation</h2>
                    <p>Headings are for convenience and do not affect interpretation. Words such as “including” or “includes” are deemed to be followed by “without limitation”. Translated versions of these Terms are provided for convenience; the English version controls in the event of conflict.</p>

                    <h2>36. Contact Information</h2>
