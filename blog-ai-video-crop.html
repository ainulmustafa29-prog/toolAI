            <!-- Short Introduction -->
            <div class="blog-content">
                <p class="lead">Crop videos to exact aspect ratios with our AI Video Crop tool. This powerful tool uses advanced artificial intelligence to intelligently crop videos to custom aspect ratios including square (1:1), portrait (9:16), landscape (16:9), standard (4:3), or custom dimensions while maintaining quality and visual appeal. Perfect for content creators, social media managers, and anyone who needs videos in specific aspect ratios for different platforms. The AI analyzes video content and applies intelligent cropping that preserves important subjects and maintains composition quality throughout the entire video.</p>

                <!-- How to Use This Tool -->
                <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">How to Use This Tool</h2>
                <p>Using the AI Video Crop tool is simple and requires no technical expertise. Start by uploading your video through the upload area or by dragging and dropping your file. The tool supports various formats including MP4, MOV, AVI, and more. Once your video is uploaded, select your desired aspect ratio from the dropdown menu. Choose from preset options like 1:1 (Square), 9:16 (Portrait), 16:9 (Landscape), 4:3 (Standard), or select Custom to enter specific width and height dimensions. Click the "Crop Video" button to start processing. The AI analyzes your video's content frame by frame and intelligently crops to match your selected aspect ratio while preserving important subjects. The process typically takes several minutes depending on video length. Once complete, preview your cropped video in the output area. The AI maintains composition quality and preserves important content throughout the video. If satisfied, download your cropped video.</p>

                <!-- Why Use This Tool? -->
                <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Why Use This Tool?</h2>
                <p>The AI Video Crop tool solves the common problem of having videos in the wrong aspect ratio for your needs. Different platforms require different aspect ratios - Instagram posts need square videos, stories require portrait format, and YouTube needs landscape dimensions. Instead of manually cropping and potentially losing important content, you can intelligently crop videos to fit any format. The AI understands video composition and preserves important subjects while adapting to the target aspect ratio. This saves time and preserves your video content while adapting it to any platform or design requirement. Whether you're creating social media content, preparing videos for different platforms, or adapting footage for specific formats, this tool ensures your videos fit perfectly without losing important elements.</p>

                <!-- Popular Use Cases -->

                <p>The AI Video Crop tool is essential for various professional and personal applications. Social media managers crop videos for different platforms - converting landscape videos to portrait for Instagram Stories or square for posts. Content creators adapt videos for different platforms and aspect ratios. Businesses create versatile videos that work across multiple channels. The tool is also perfect for creating videos that need to work in both portrait and landscape orientations. Whether you need videos for social media, web use, or specific formats, this tool delivers exceptional results.</p>
