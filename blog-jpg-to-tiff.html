                                TIFF files are typically larger than JPG files because TIFF format uses lossless compression or uncompressed storage. The file size increase depends on the image, but TIFF files are generally 3-10 times larger than equivalent JPG files. This is the trade-off for maximum quality preservation.

                                While there's no strict file size limit, we recommend images under 10MB for optimal performance. Larger files may take longer to process. The converted TIFF will maintain the original image's resolution and quality.
