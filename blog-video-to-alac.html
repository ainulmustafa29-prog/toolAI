                                Both ALAC and FLAC are lossless audio formats, but ALAC is Apple's format while FLAC is open-source. ALAC is optimized for Apple devices and iTunes, while FLAC is more widely supported across platforms. Both preserve perfect audio quality, but ALAC is the better choice for Apple users.

                                Processing time varies based on video length. Short videos (under 1 minute) typically process in 1-2 minutes, while longer videos may take 5-10 minutes. The process extracts audio and converts to ALAC efficiently.

                                Yes, ALAC files are larger than MP3 files because ALAC is lossless while MP3 is lossy. ALAC files are typically 3-5 times larger than equivalent MP3 files, but they preserve perfect audio quality. This is the trade-off for lossless, uncompressed quality.

                                While there's no strict video length limit, we recommend videos under 10 minutes for optimal performance. Longer videos may take significantly more time to process. The extracted ALAC will maintain the full lossless audio quality from your original video.
